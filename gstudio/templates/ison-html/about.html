</table>

<p>The Eyes on ISON Campaign is built upon the experiences of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 and the Transit of Venus 2012, which were marked by partnerships between professionals, amateurs and activists.</p>

<p>The seeds of this campaign were sowed in February, 2013 at the All-India Peoples' Science Congress in Lucknow, where, taking ahead the notion of Universalising the Universe using the arrival of the Comet ISON event was mooted. A brain-storming meeting of interested individuals followed in April 2013 at their Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, TIFR, Mumbai. At this meeting a loose organisational structure was created and an action plan was formulated to (a) generate freely downloadable multi-lingual resource material and (b) conduct a country-wide cascading set of workshops to train resource persons who would conduct astronomy-related  activities at the local level. </p>
